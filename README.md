<!-- PERSONALIZED NOTES FOR THE AUTHOR (YUP!! AM TALKING ABOUT ME HERE!!) -->
<!-- Backend
    1. initialize a node project
    2. put a package.json (npm init)
    3. install express (npm i express)
    4. NOTE we never share node modules folder(we delete it) with anyone thats why it is important to maintain package.json file as it contains all the dependencies so whenever the other user want to run the project on its local machine they can simply run **npm install*
    5. make index.js file theen write express boiler code
    6. then ideally next step would be of zod, here we have created types.js file.
    7. Now after making the zod file and importing it to the main index.js file and after completing the all the routes 
    8. Now we'll make the database and connecting it to the main app 
    9. That's the end of the backend work.
